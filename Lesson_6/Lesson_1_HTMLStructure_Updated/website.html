<!DOCTYPE html> <!--Used to tell browser to use latest version of HTML-->
<html> <!--Says a webpage is present inside it-->
  <head>
<!--If element is inside element that is called nested elements-->
<!--HTML element is designed for nesting-->
<!-- It is defined to contain one head and one body element -->
<!--All the element will go either head or body element-->
<!--Notice: Head and Body is also designed for nesting-->
<!--Body element: It is suppose to contain all the visible content-->
<!--Head element: It is suppose to contain all the non-visible content-->
<!--Head element is useful when we want to add title or need to reload webpage automatically-->

    <p>paragraph of text</p>  <!-- This is a paragraph Element in HTML -->
    <button>Hello</button>    <!-- This is a button Element in HTML -->
    <br> <!--Break Element in HTML-->

    <!--- On running the above code in any web browser (i.e. Chrome, Edge) will provide first paragraph and then a button Hello -->
    <!-- If we reverse the order the botton and paragraph code lines then the order on web browser is also reversered -->
    <!-- This is due to a fact that in HTML the reading is done line by line -->

    <br> <!-- Break Element in HTML -->
    <button>Hello2</button>    <!-- This is a button Element in HTML -->
    <p>paragraph of text if order is reversed</p>  <!-- This is a paragraph Element in HTML -->

    <!-- <button> is HTML Tag. It basically tells the computer what we are trying to create -->
    <!-- Here, button is the Tag Name -->
    <!-- Every element contains two tag. -->
    <!-- Opening Tag: To start the Element -->
    <!-- Closing Tag: Similar to Opening Tag except it has "/" before the Tag Name. It denotes the End of the element -->
    <!-- Between then Opening and Closing Tag, We can write our text or contain -->





    <!-- ..............................Lesson - 1 (Linking a website)..................................................... -->
    <!-- Now we are going to link a website -->
    <!-- To link an element we use anchore element "a" -->
    <!-- anchore element is similar to button or p -->
    <a>Link to Google.Com</a>
    <br>
    <!-- The Above code created a paragraph but on clicking it we are not going anywhere -->
    <!-- This is because we have not provided it any destination -->
    <!-- To add desination we use " href="Link of desination" ". This is a HTML attributes that represents how an element behaves. -->
    <!-- Note: Space is must between Tag name and attribute. -->
    <!-- href is Attribute name (In our case, href) -->
    <!-- inside double quotes is attribute value (In our case, the Link of destination) -->

    <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Link to Google.Com</a>
    <br>

    <!-- We can also add mutiple attributes -->
    <a href="https://www.google.co.in/" target="_blank">Link to Google.Com with multiple attributes</a>
    <!-- Here, target is used to tell my browser to open the Link on new tab by inserting _blank as a value -->
